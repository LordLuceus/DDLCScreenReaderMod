Doki Doki Literature Club is my love letter to that.  \nGames are an interactive art. Some let you explore new worlds, some challenge your mind in broad new ways. Some make you feel like a hero or a friend, even when life is hard on you. Some games are just plain fun \u2013 and that\u2019s okay, too.  \n\nEveryone likes different kinds of games. People who enjoy dating sims may have a heightened empathy for fictional characters, or they might be experiencing feelings that life has not been kind enough to offer them. If they are enjoying themselves, then that\u2019s all that matters. That goes for shooting games, casual games, sandbox games \u2013 anything. Preferences are preferences, and our differences are the reason we have a thriving video game industry.  \n\nMy own favorite games have always been ones that challenge the status quo. Even if not a masterpiece, any game that attempts something wildly different may earn a special place in my heart. Anything that further pushes the limitless bounds of interactive media.  \n\nI extend my true gratitude to all those who have taken the time to achieve full completion. I hope you enjoyed playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.  \n\nThank you for being a part of my Literature Club!  \n\nLove,  \nDan Salvato",

There once was a ladybug.
It was so small, it took a really long time to
crawl from here to there.
It was very tiring to fly for too long.

Nobody squishes ladybugs because they're cute.
Does that make them better than other bugs?
Do ladybugs know they're cute?
I think they're too preoccupied with bug things.

And so, the ladybug crawled around and did bug
things.
This story wasn't really going anywhere.
But I know you don't mind.
I hope you think it's nice for being there
anyway.
