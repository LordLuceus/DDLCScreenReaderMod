Monika, a young woman with long brown hair and green eyes, sits at an outdoor cafe table, smiling as she holds up a heart-shaped chocolate. On the table are two cups of coffee, an open box of chocolates, and a greeting card. The card has a heart next to the word ""You"" and a list of names: Monika, Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki, with the last three names crossed out. In the bushes behind her, small, stylized figures of Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki are visible.

Yuri, a girl with long purple hair, lies on her stomach on a wooden floor, looking up with a flustered expression at a hand reaching down to her. She holds a playing card with a heart to her chest, surrounded by lit candles, crumpled paper, a pen, and two envelopes sealed with hearts.

Monika and Yuri are lying side-by-side on a bed of pillows and blankets on a wooden floor, illuminated by a sliver of sunlight. Yuri, who has long dark purple hair, is asleep and holding a red book to her chest. Monika, with long light brown hair, is awake and winking at the viewer with her hand resting on Yuri's arm. The book's cover reads ""EASILY DISTURBED"" in white, uneven letters.

Natsuki, a girl with short pink hair in a school uniform, sits on a tiled floor surrounded by baking supplies. She holds an open red cookbook in one hand and a spoon with chocolate batter in the other, with a pink stand mixer and a bowl of batter beside her. The book's cover reads ""Valentines Recipes,"" and nearby cartons are labeled ""Silky Milk"" and ""Cocoa Powder 100% CACAO.""

Monika stands in the center of the frame against a black, star-filled sky. She wears her school uniform and has her long brown hair tied in a high ponytail with a large white bow. Monika looks directly forward with a slight smile.

Sayori, a girl with short, coral-pink hair and a large red bow, sits cross-legged on a wooden floor while wrapping a small pink gift box. She holds a piece of red string between her teeth to keep it taut as her hands work on tying it. Various gift-wrapping supplies, including scissors, a tape dispenser, bows, and a gift bag, are scattered on the floor around her.

From a first-person perspective, Monika holds the viewer's hand and leads them forward. She looks back over her shoulder with a gentle smile, her long, pinkish-brown hair tied in a high ponytail with a large ribbon and adorned with small blue flowers. She is wearing a light purple sundress and a blue beaded bracelet in a sunlit, out-of-focus park.

The four main characters are gathered in Halloween costumes around a large jack-o'-lantern candy bowl. From left to right: a girl in a dark, hooded robe reads a book while drinking red liquid from a cup; a girl in a frilly pink dress eats a piece of candy; a girl in a cow onesie holds a chocolate bar labeled ""CHOCO""; and a girl with angel wings and a halo holds a lollipop. The background is a dark red pattern with bat silhouettes and spiderwebs, and a single eyeball rests on the floor near a candle.
